# Arkanoid_gamge
Arkanoind game (game with platform and ball) made with ESP32 microcontroller, MAX7219/7221, Joystick
## This scheme uses direct connections with matrix and MAX7219/7221 with no adapters which makes the project more complicated.
If you want to play this game, connect all the parts that are shown on the scheme and then upload the code to your microcontroller.
Use MAX7219/7221 datasheet in order to understand the connection and othe properties : https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max7219-max7221.pdf
